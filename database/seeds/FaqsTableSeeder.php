We provide clients the ability to deposit and withdraw funds to our corporate wallet for safe keeping while the funds are being exchanged or trade, but we do not provide a personal wallet service. Kowrii Exchange uses cold storage and a hot wallet like many digital asset exchanges, so your sending address for a digital asset will not be the same as your deposit address. Do not attempt to withdraw digital assets from Kowrii Exchange if ownership of the sending address is relevant to the transaction (for example, if you’re depositing into an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) address, Kowrii Exchange’s hot wallet will be the depositor and not your personal Kowrii Exchange deposit address). If you do deposit to a Kowrii Exchange address that is not listed on your deposit page, it will not be possible for us to return the funds. It is your responsibility to ensure that the address to which you are depositing is listed on your deposit page. If you withdraw from Kowrii Exchange to a third party that returns the withdrawal to the address from which it was sent, those assets will not be recoverable by Kowrii Exchange. Please take the relevant steps to prevent your funds from being sent to addresses that are not listed on the deposit page of your account.",

Here’s a brief summary: Databases containing sensitive user data aren’t accessible from our site. They’re encrypted and can’t be decrypted without access to multiple highly secured systems. By far the most likely scenario for leakage of personal data would be user-specific, rather than a breach of the database as a whole – that is, if someone gained access to your personal login credentials, and could then see the same personal information you can see when you log into your account. But we provide many security tools to help you secure your account. At minimum, you should have Two-factor Authentication (2FA) for account login and set up a Master Key. You may also want to add Global Settings Lock (GSL) to your account. Securing your account Here at Kowrii Exchange, we provide a number of security features that can make your account more secure. We recommend that you secure your account in the following ways: Basic Set up Two-factor Authentication (2FA). Set up a Master Key to require authentication for account recovery. Secure the email account registered to your Kowrii Exchange account with a strong password and Two-factor Authentication (2FA). Advanced Lock your account settings with the Global Settings Lock to prevent withdrawal addresses from being added even if an attacker gains access to your account. If your email supports PGP signing and encryption, provide us with your PGP key to receive signed and encrypted email from us. Set up Two-factor Authentication (2FA) for deposits and withdrawals and/or trading (note that the Global Settings Lock must be set in order for these to be effective).",
